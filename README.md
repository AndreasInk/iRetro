## What if iRetro?
iRetro is a music app built for SwiftUIJam that reminds you of the past while building your future with the power of music.  

## Why we built it
We built iRetro to bring back nostalgia while empowering people with music.

## Challenges faced
The first major challenge was to establish the classic click wheel of the iPod Classic.  The second challenge was to read music from the user's library.  Each challenge was difficult, but with research and perseverance, we solved the challenges.

## The future
We plan to release iRetro to the App Store and empower people with music and nostalgia.

## Thank you
Just want to say thank you to SwiftUIJam for hosting this jam and offering the opportunity to have such a fun and learning filled weekend!
